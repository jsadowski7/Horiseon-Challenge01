# Horiseon: Search Engine Optimization

```
# Description

```
For this Challenge, a marketing agency, Horiseon, tasked me with refactoring existing code for a website. This included using semantic html and css elements to reorganize the code to make it more accessible and easier to read for other developers. In addition, some issues in the html were fixed as well.

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
